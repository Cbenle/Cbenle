## 👋 About Me

Starting Fall 2026, I will be a third-year Ph.D. student in **Statistics and Data Science**. My research interests include **stochastic finance**, **financial econometrics**, and **data science**, with a focus on applying statistical and computational methods to financial and economic problems.

I was born and raised in **Ghana**, where I earned my **B.S. in Actuarial Science** from **Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)**. My academic background in actuarial science and statistics has shaped my interest in quantitative modeling, risk analysis, and data-driven decision-making.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, listening to music, going for walks, and watching or playing soccer. I follow both local and international football leagues when time permits.
